# carbon_emission

This app is created using python kivy. This app has a frontend created in python kivy, backend in python and a sqlite3 database. The user is given an option to login or register. Once the user is logged in to the app, the user can view different types of carbon emission reports for Irvine gasoline. The user can click on different buttons and generate graphs to view the net carbon emissions in the different sectors of operation of Irvine Gasoline. Apart from that, the user has the option to predict the next year's net carbon emissions and carbon emissions per sector. Based on this predicted value the user can get an idea if they need to offset for the carbon emissions or not. Moreover, the algorithm used to predict the values is the ARIMA autoregression algorithm. Moreover, to nicely tune the model a value of (1,0,0) is passed is to predict the most accurate values for the carbon emissios. The algorithm used to find which company Irvine Gasoline needs to give contract based on the fact that if the total emissions to offset are less than 3000 metric tonnnes, then the min cost company is chosen. Otherwise, the company with the minimum metric tonnes offsetted is chosen.
